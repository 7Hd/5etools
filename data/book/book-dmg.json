				"本書還有另兩本重要輔助資料:《玩家手冊》中包含了你的玩家們用來創作角色，以及你用以進行遊戲的規則，而《怪物圖鑑》中則收集了生活在D&D世界中的各種怪物，隨時可以用於你的戰役。",

						"地下城主 (DM) 是一場D&D遊戲背後的創造之力。 DM 創造供其他玩家探索的世界，同時創造並主持那些推動故事的冒險(adventures)。一場冒險的核心即完成一項任務委託，有些短的任務只需要一次聚會的遊戲時間就可以完成。而更長的冒險則可能讓玩家們捲入更大規模的衝突，並需要好幾次聚會的遊戲時間才能最終解決。這些連續的冒險即就構成持續的戰役(campaign)。一個D&D 戰役可能包含有幾十次冒險，可以持續遊戲數月甚至數年的時間。",
						"地下城主需要兼顧許多身份。要作為戰役的設計師為其他玩家(或者說，冒險者)佈置怪物，安置陷阱，設置寶藏以構成一場冒險。而作為故事的講述者，DM還要幫其他玩家想像其周圍正在發生事情，並在其做出意外行為時以即興創作應對。 DM即作為表演者生動的演繹怪物和配角，又要作整個遊戲的裁判者，以解釋規則並決定何時遵守規則，何時又要修改規則。",
						"創造、書寫、講述、應對、表演、裁判一一每個DM實行這些扮演要素的水平不盡相同，而你一樣或許會偏好其中的某些方面。這恰恰也證明了D&D只是業餘愛好，而擔任 DM應當是為了樂趣。專注於你喜歡的部分，其餘則可以一筆帶過。舉個例子，如果你不喜歡創作自己的冒險，完全可以直接使用出版刊物上得內容。有時你還可以依靠其他玩家的智慧，以讓其協助你主導規則和創作世界。",
						"D&D的規則可以協助你與其他玩家愉快的遊戲，但是不能指望讓規則作為主導。作為DM，你才是遊戲的主控人。換句話說，你的目標不是消滅冒險者們，而是創造一個以冒險者的行動和決定為中心的戰役世界，並讓你的玩家們欲罷不能!有些難忘的戰役事件，甚至會在遊戲聚會結束後的多年裡一直作為玩家們的珍貴回憶。"

								"你的戰役發生在其中一個設定好的D&D世界中，然後眾多這種會發生無數冒險故事的位面與世界，便綜合成D&D的多元宇宙(multiverse)。即使你使用如被遺忘國度那樣設計好的世界，你的戰役也只是發生在一個與之相似的“鏡像世界”中，它可能與那個由系列小說、遊戲產品、數碼遊戲等記述了許多故事的被遺忘國度會稍有不同。你可以適度的修改這個世界，當然你也要考慮好如何應對玩家們的行動因修改而造成的後果。",
								"你的世界不該只作為冒險的背景板。它應該更像中土世界(Middle Earth)和維斯特洛(Westeros)那樣有著無數奇幻文學的世界，是一處可以讓你暫時遠離現實喧辦，見證傳奇故事緩緩開幕的地方。設計精妙、運作良好的世界應當包容著冒險者，讓其感覺自己是世界一員而非被完全孤立在外。",
								"連貫性是一個虛構世界顯得可信的關鍵。冒險者們返城補給時，應當會遇上曾經見過面的非玩家角色 (NPC 們)。他們會馬上想起酒吧老闆的名字，而老闆也會記得冒險者們。你可以成功營造這種連貫感後，還可以進一步設置一些偶然變化。如果冒險者們回到馬厩買更多馬匹，他們可能會發現之前經營這裡的男子已經返回其遠方大城市的家鄉，現在則是他的侄女在運營這間家族產業。這種改變不會直接影響冒險者，但會讓他們產生細微的印象。這種印象會讓玩家們覺得自己的角色是鮮活世界的一部分，而整個世界也會隨冒險者的腳步而成長變化。",
								"本書的整個第1部分將講述如何創造你的世界。第1章有讓你了解自己想運行遊戲的類型，並助你確立一些世界中必不可少的細節以及設定世界中最突出的矛盾。第2章助你將世界容納進多元宇宙這個廣闊的舞台，並擴展一些《玩家手冊》中提及的資料，講述諸位面、各色神只，以及你如何將其應用到戰役。"

Adventurers bring magical powers to bear against the monstrous threats they face. These characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, but something impels them into an adventuring life. The adventurers are the \"heroes\" of the campaign, but they might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to destroy monsters or villains.",

Fighter, rogue, and barbarian characters tend to be far more common than wizards, clerics, or paladins.

Magic items are therefore rare and often dangerous.",

Ability checks to climb don't involve careful searching for holds but let characters bounce up walls or from tree to tree. Warriors stun their opponents by striking pressure points.

Several times a day, however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky.",
								"The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the {@b Sea of Worlds}, dotted here and there with atolls and islands that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move across the sea sometimes create temporary portals to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever returning home.",
								"The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare occasions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire islands and driving ships down to the reefs.",
								"Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of Worlds, called the {@b Sea of Light} because of the sunlight filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal emperor of the marids dwells in the {@b Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls}, an opulent palace made of coral and studded with pearls.",
								"The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight reaches, are called the {@b Darkened Depths}. Horrid creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other mighty leviathans claim this realm.",

Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea and thus ignore these habitations.",

								"At the other extreme of the plane is the {@b Sea of Ice}, bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with icebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of Water to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas.",

Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of Ice, home to yetis, remorhazes, white dragons, and other creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure their survival.",

Comic series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good comparisons, because of the way individual adventures are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger narrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a campaign is the series as a whole.",

				"Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified whole that meets the needs of your players and your campaign.

The adventure key turns a simple sketch of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters designed to entertain and intrigue your players.",

Some clues connect the wrong suspect to the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing in a different direction, or come across evidence that absolves the suspect.",

If the adventurers solve the mystery too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but the players will feel a sense of accomplishment.

The Xanathar's spherical body is covered in leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its eyestalks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its central eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all beholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions.",

Its flaw is a weakness for exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and rare spices and herbs.",

A wilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a harrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread can be an exciting adventure in its own right.

								"Sometimes the destination is more important than the journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get the characters to where the real adventure happens, gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in your players' minds before moving on.",
								"Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep the forward momentum. \"You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest\" is okay, but far less evocative and memorable than, \"A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary.\" The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the desired mood rather than describe everything down to the last blade of grass.",
								"Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest.",
								"In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches on the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes (in fact, that's a good phrase to search for) both real and fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, spice up your descriptions with some truly magical element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can break your players' sense of immersion in the world. A single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic and memorable landscape is enough.",
								"Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your adventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass.",
								"In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs of corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and rocks covered with slimy brown moss-can be a signal that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil power that is their destination or can provide clues to the nature of the threats to be found there.",
								"Specific wilderness locations might have their own special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and the Spider haunt Woods might feature different kinds of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different weather, and different random encounter tables.",
								"Finally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling attention to the weather. \"You spend the next three days crossing the swamp\" sounds less harrowing than, \"You spend the next three days trudging through knee-deep mud-the first two days and nights in the pouring rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood.\""

								"Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and attention as the destination. If wilderness travel features prominently in your adventure and isn't something you want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; you'll need to know the party's marching order and have encounters at the ready.",
								"Let your players determine the party's marching order (see the {@i Player's Handbook} for more information). Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back rank are usually responsible for making sure that the party isn't being followed. Encourage characters in the middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge along behind the front-rank characters. The {@i Player's Handbook} suggests activities such as mapmaking and foraging for food.",
								"Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead of time) and random encounters (encounters determined by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a map of the location where the encounter is set to occur, such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other memorable location. Random encounters tend to be less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters you have, the more you'll need to rely on random encounters to keep the journey interesting. See chapter 3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter tables and when to check for random encounters.",
								"A good way to keep wilderness encounters from becoming stale is to make sure they don't all start and end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to keep your players' interest. If one encounter comes at the adventurers from the front, the next one might come at them from above or behind. If an encounter features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the party's pack animals might get the first indication that monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If an encounter features loud monsters, the party might have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of monsters might attack the party on sight, and another might allow safe passage for food.",
								"Reward characters for searching while they travel by providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or provide hooks for further adventures. A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage approach to bridge gaps between encounters."

How do you avoid creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging across a rocky wasteland?",

If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it.

No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.",

										"Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.",

Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.",

Each creature has a front arc (the direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.",
										"A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.",
										"Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it only against attacks from the front and left arcs.",
										"Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.",
										"On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.",
										"A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it's in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in the side arc."
